⚙ How Matching Works

1. Text is extracted from the resume (PDF).
2. JD and resume text are cleaned, tokenized, and stop words are removed.
3. Matching is done based on overlapping keywords.
4. Success rate is calculated:  
   **Success % = (Matched Terms / JD Terms) × 100**
5. Missing terms are shown as improvement tips.
